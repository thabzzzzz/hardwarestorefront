Place your favicon files here so Next.js serves them from the root URL.

Common files to add:
- favicon.ico
- favicon-16x16.png
- favicon-32x32.png
- apple-touch-icon.png
- site.webmanifest
- safari-pinned-tab.svg

After copying, run a hard refresh in your browser to see the new icons.

If you also want the same favicons available to the Laravel app, copy these files into the project `public/` directory.
